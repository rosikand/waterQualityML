# waterQualityML
Inland water systems are essential to our environment because they are vital ecosystems that are bio-diverse. Thus, finding innovative ways to monitor water quality is vital. In this repository, I present various machine learning algorithms that takes in multispectral remote sensing data from the AquaSat data set as input to predict optically active water quality parameters as desired output.
